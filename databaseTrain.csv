Some even state that the youngsters were careless because they visited the beach despite there being numerous warnings against the same. Not only are these claims uncorroborated, but also they are false and present a version of events which did not take place at all, which only shows the sheer lack of responsibility and ethics displayed by the news channels and media houses concerned. \n\nThe articles claim she fell 300ft from the top of a **lighthouse** after she **slipped** while taking a selfie. When in reality she was never on a lighthouse, and the she never slipped from said lighthouse and she was not taking a selfie on said lighthouse. The newspaper even got the location wrong, it mentions a different beach.\n\n**Actual Events:**\n\nPranita, who was a student of National Law University, Jodhpur, was visiting Gokarna with four of her friends. They were at Kumta beach, and were sitting on some rocks which were about 10-15 feet above sea, when due to unexpected high tide, 3 of the youngsters, including the deceased, were flown away by a giant wave. Two of them were brought back to the shore by another wave, but the deceased, whose glasses had come off, continued to struggle as she held on to a rock for support she bravely struggled  and tried to swim for 45 mins. Unfortunately, she lost her grip, and was carried towards the deeper end of the sea by the waves. \nThe friends promptly called the Police as well as the Management of the Hotel they were staying at, and proceeded to seek help from the local residents from a nearby village. However, they could not understand the youngsters\xe2\x80\x99 plea for help, and by the time they did send some help, about forty minutes had already passed and the deceased was out of sight. She was brought back ashore on a boat by some of the local fishermen, and was pronounced dead by the authorities. Her body was taken for post-mortem and was handed over to her relatives afterwards.\n\n**She was an amazing person**, extremely intelligent, she was the class topper and represented  India and NLUJ at prestigious events such as Jessup, she was kind and warm hearted. Her batchmates, teachers, seniors and even our Alumni have been rallying on facebook and on twitter, spreading the story of what really happened and contacting government officials (Arun jately among others) to take some action against these newspapers but I doubt they will listen to a hundred students. Her family has been mourning the loss of their great daughter, the last thing they need is her being mocked and laughed at for dying while taking a selfie.\n\nAll we want is that her family is not harassed by untrue depictions of the event which belittle the huge amount of respect that she has earned through her hardwork. \n\nI would request you to please check your facts before publishing such news articles.\n\n\nThis is also a reminder to all of  you that everytime you read a story where the victim died in this way might actually just be a cooked up tale. \n\nFor Pranita.\n***\nEdit: Guys please, if something here offends you then please let me know, but please do not downvote this, we dont want her to be remembered this way, we want to get the true story out.\n\n***\n\nEDIT: for those who wanted proof **COPY OF FIR CORROBORATING THE STORY** http://imgur.com/a/s9djo\n\n***\n\n# We did it reddit! \n\n* **ScoopWhoop** http://www.scoopwhoop.com/Remember-The-Law-Student-Who-Died-While-Clicking-A-Selfie-In-Gokarna-The-Story-Is-Apparently-False\n\n* **Legally India:** http://www.legallyindia.com/law-schools/nlu-jodhpurians-try-to-protect-memory-of-student-whose-drowning-misreported-by-media-as-sensational-daredevil-selfie-death\n\n* **Bar and Bench:** http://barandbench.com/setting-record-straight-counter-misreportage-nlu-jodhpur-students-death/\n\n* **the story is now international- Irish mirror** : http://www.irishmirror.ie/news/world-news/tragic-student-washed-cliffs-front-8099439\n\n* **Indian Express:** http://indianexpress.com/article/trending/trending-in-india/nlu-jodhpur-law-student-selfie-death-drowning-2831110/#sthash.iXLC56nI.gbpl&st_refDomain=m.facebook.com&st_refQuery=/\n\n* **UK mirror:** http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/tragic-student-washed-cliffs-front-8099439\n\n(UK and Irish mirror had published the incorrect version of events but promptly changed the article once the true version was pointed out by students through email)\n\n* **The Quint:** http://www.thequint.com/india/2016/06/02/selfie-attempt-nlu-student-media-falsely-reports-cause-of-death\n\n* **As of 9:45 PM , The Article on 'The Hindu' has been taken down**\n\n* **As of 11 pm IST , TOI has taken down the video**\n\n* **TOI has now published the correct version of events** http://m.timesofindia.com/city/bengaluru/21-year-old-Jodhpur-student-drowns-in-beach-accident/articleshow/52560523.cms   \n\n* **India Times:** http://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/hey-media-stop-spreading-lies-about-the-perfectselfie-death-of-this-college-girl-256125.html\n\n* **Drishtikone:** http://drishtikone.com/toi-hindu-made-mockery-young-girls-death/\n\n(DrishtiKone has claimed someone to be OP of this post, I have not given my identity away to anyone, and am not the person mentioned therein)\n\n\n* **As of 11 am IST (3rd June 16) Hindustan Times has taken down the incorrect article**\n\n* **As of 2pm , News X has put up the correct version of events:** http://www.newsx.com/national/30570-law-student-falls-to-death-from-cliff-at-gokarna-beach-karnataka\n\n* **9 PM IST, Indian Express:** http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/law-student-who-died-a-selfie-death-of-media-didnt-even-have-her-phone-with-her-2833051/\n\n* **10 PM IST, The Hoot:** http://www.thehoot.org/media-watch/media-practice/mainstream-medias-collective-fictionalising-9403\n\n* **11:30 PM , The Hindu has posted a correction:** http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/correction/article8684326.ece\n \nScoopWhoop has retracted its previous story and apologised to her family and many other websites are doing the same.

But also unlucky in the sense that a handful of my relatives also live in Delhi.\n\nHere\'s a highlight of how my last 5 days have been when they visited\n\n* Initially I had to endure gasps, shudders and shivers of them when they realize about my "Living arrangement" and how "apposit Jendaars" are not supposed to live together.\n\n* Then I experienced a satisfaction almost equal to 1/10th of an orgasm when I saw their faces while they "inform" my dad(who couldn\'t give two shits about it. He\'s cool like that.)\n\n* Then some other bullshit was uttered around me about homeopathy, patanjali or some pehelwan in some gali or chowk who can cure me within a minute.\n\n* Then came a 2nd wave of gasps and horrific squeals when they realized there is no temple or statue at home.\n\n* In the evening my girlfriend comes from work, so naturally my relatives **HAD** to know what her parents do, earn, spend, overpronate, underpronate???\n\n* Then when they were checking out the rest of the house and saw that the bedroom is being shared (and this is the best part) they acted as if I\'ve murdered their children.\n\n* My bua also got disgusted when she found out I was washing both of ours clothes as it is *ladies* work (This is the only time I was legit pissed) \n\n* My gf has a full sleeve tattoo for which my maami had a questionnaire ready\n\n* Honb\'l mention- It was Navratri and the maid had prepared chicken and rice in Lunch so that was fun.\n\n* Another honb\'l mention: All of them know that I drink. Because I got many of my cousins drunk in a family wedding some years back. But when they found the bottles and asked me whether she drinks or not and when I said yes she does. Their immediate response was *But girls can\'t drink.*  \nAs if it\'s anatomically impossible for chicks to drink alcohol.\n\nAnd I am 24 btw. Just for perspective for how ridiculous they are.\n\nAlso my mom told me last night that she got a call from everyone saying  "*Ladka bohot open ho gaya hai. Iski shaadi karado.*"',b'87f85p',b't3_87f85p',b'My relatives visited me. And I live with my girlfriend unbeknownst to them. And they lost their shit. And it was a thing of beauty.

There was no sign about exact toll to be paid, everyone paid a fixed price, some paid none. That made me suspect of scheme. \n\nSo I made an RTI application, asking cost of bridge, copy of toll collection GO, vendor collecting the toll currently, how much toll period is left etc. The Bridge dept made my application to travel from dept to dept for a year and half. Ultimately gave me almost everything (I need to send application to another dept for part of application) In mean time, I used to ask my relatives about status of bridge toll JLT. and I got to know that one fine day (within 2 weeks, after receiving RTI reply) with lot of fanfare local politician said that he is doing a seva to public by removing the toll on on all such bridges, 13 in total.\n\nFun Fact: \n\n* 1. I filed RTI only for one bridge and this corruption was found that bridge dept, local mafia, police and politicians were milking 3-4 lakhs everyday. 5000 vehicles on each bridgex Rs 5 per vehicle x 13 bridges = 3.25 lakh. \n* 2. Cost of bridge (23 lakh) was not recovered even after 25 years. Irony is local politician trying to be saint/hero by not involving in corruption.\n* 3. I happen to meet someone who bragged about his uncle being the toll collector for toll station I had filed RTI, while this whole thing was going on.\n\nI could do all these as I was using office address, whose entry was heavily regulated under STPI laws. **It is 10 years now, but I have been told to never talk about this to anyone, else I may get killed.** Crazy.',b'8k08vv',b't3_8k08vv',b'I made 13 illegal toll booth vanish overnight, milking 3-4 lakhs everyday, using RTI'

[R]eddiquette,2264,149,1550289254.0,0.98,askquestionsdude,b'So I was talking to a friend yesterday who was disturbed by the recent Pulwama attack and during the conversation she referred to the victims as the Indian army soldiers. It wasn\'t very surprising for me as I\'ve been seeing this misconception for years, even among the educated lot of the country. However, the cowardly attack on CRPF really boiled my blood and I strongly felt that they deserved to be addressed as who they are. And they are not the army. \n\nFollowing five forces were earlier considered paramilitary forces, but from March 2011 have been reclassified as Central Armed Police Forces to avoid confusion with Assam Rifles and Special Frontier Force (SFF):\n\n    Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) \n    Border Security Force (BSF) \n    Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) \n    Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) \n    Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB)\n\nCRPF is like the first responder for almost all of the internal security or "war-like" situations whereas the army is brought in during the war. CRPF faces the stone pelters in Kashmir. It is they who face bullets of the naxals. BSF guards our borders, not the army always. They have to make way for the army when a war is imminent. ITBP is stationed along the Indo-Tibetan border protects us from the Chinese forces. \n\nThe CRPF or the CAPF in general, comes under the Ministry Of Home Affairs while the army comes under the Ministry Of Defence. MHA has almost equal number of mouths to feed, if not more, compared to the MoD but the MoD takes a substantially bigger piece of the budget pie everytime because MoD procurements are expensive (remember Rafale? I only wonder how all that extra money could have been utilized).\n\nCAPF is not treated on par with the army even in terms of pay & perks. \n\n>A low-ranking army soldier typically receives one-and-a-half times the pay of a CRPF officer of equivalent experience\n\n>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re like a body,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, referring to all the security forces, including the army. \xe2\x80\x9cJust because the heart is more important, you can\xe2\x80\x99t ignore the knee.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCAPF personnel live in very poor and conflict ridden conditions for very extended periods of time (remember the BSF jawan\'s viral video complaining low standards of food?). The conditions that they live in are so dire that diseases like malaria, dengue, heart attacks, depression and suicides kill 16 times more CRPF personnel in maoist hit regions compared to those slain by the rebels. \n\n>Junior home minister Hansraj Gangaram Ahir told the Lok Sabha that 74 CRPF personnel were killed in offensives against the rebels, while 1,196 lost their lives because of medical reasons. In a written reply, the minister said 219 jawans succumbed to heart attacks, 77 died because of depression or by committing suicide, and 20 due to malaria and dengue. Another 880 died due to "other" unspecified medical reasons.\n\nThey even have a hard time rehabilitating after retirements. Suicide rates are very high in the paramilitary both during and post service.\n\n> Nearly 700 personnel of the Central Armed Police Forces committed suicide in the last six years, more than those killed in action, the Union Home Ministry has told a parliamentary panel. The reasons include "lack of stability, loneliness and domestic strife".\n\nTL;DR:\n\nWe comfortably deify the army but we don\'t understand that it is not just the army that is keeping us safe. Being able to make this distinction between our various forces gives us the ability to address their critical concerns. Let us not be so thankless. Let us not be so ignorant. Let us give these brave CAPF soldiers the recognition and status they deserve. \n\nBut more importantly let us pay them well for their services because they are not just fighting for honour, they are also fighting to feed their loved ones, to send their kids to college, to build a house, to pay their old parents\' medical bills. In addition to fighting for the country,  these soldiers are fighting for themselves like you and me.\n\n[Attacked CRPF is a poor cousin to Indian army: former officers](https://in.reuters.com/article/india-kashmir-dead/attacked-crpf-is-a-poor-cousin-to-indian-army-former-officers-idINKCN1Q41Y4)\n\n[Disease kills more CRPF men than rebels](https://m.telegraphindia.com/india/disease-kills-more-crpf-men-than-rebels/cid/1521241)\n\n[700 troopers committed suicide in last 6 years: MHA](https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/700-troopers-committed-suicide-in-last-six-years-mha/1275631)',b'ar504q',b't3_ar504q',b"People don't understand the differences between the army and the paramilitary.

It's unbelievable that people find it so hard to move on with time. If anyone of you have seen the movie padman, you know what I'm talking about. \n\nI am 17 and started getting my period at 13. And just as my period began I realised the shit load of rules my mom follows. We don't touch anything at home not even our own stuff. I am asked to just sit in a secluded room all day with a dirty blanket not washed since ages. I can't even go get myself a glass of water on the first day. Not allowed to touch any person at home not allowed to sit on my bed touch my phone or books anything else. Not allowed to go to kitchen or my own room. And I don't get a single speck of food on the first day of my period. And when I say a single speck it's literal. By the second day I'm so weak that it's difficult to walk. Even though agreed it's all for one day but my life literally stops.\n\nIt's not that my mom is a bad person, she is great and the amount of sacrifices she has done for me is unbelievable. But it's sad that even my crying for food doesn't melt her. She believes that because we have a small Mandir at home we are required to follow all this. \n\nDoes my period really make me so impure?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the love and support! I honestly didn't know this was that big of a problem until you people pointed it out. Especially the not eating thing. I didn't know it can have long term effects. The problem with that is that if I force my mother to let me eat then she will make me stay in that hell disgusting room for whole 2 days.

They proved how, despite their hardships, special abilities and limited support, one can make history. One must also applaud their parents and well wishers for truly believing in their children when the world generally looks down upon people with special needs & abilities.\n\nMost of these sports persons will soon return to their normal lives full of obstacles. I only hope that these men & women of passion get as much support and nurturing as possible from the govt as well as the society. They made India proud. They deserve to be rewarded and rewarded well for bringing glory to the nation. And more importantly for bringing a ray of hope in the lives of millions of others.\n\n[Their homecoming pictures are the best thing I\'ve seen today.](http://www.newindianexpress.com/galleries/sport/2019/mar/24/special-olympics-indias-medal-winners-return-home-amidst-glitzy-and-glory-102173.html)\n\nThese are the smiles that deserved extensive coverage in the media.

They are seniors who throw their weight around, and today spent 20 minutes shouting at a hapless office boy, for not keeping a glass of hot tea ready on their desk when they walked in.\n\nThey threatened to fire him and reduced him to tears.\n\nI had enough and walked over to them and gave them their due piece of mind. I brought up the history of unacceptable treatment they\'ve been meting out to the office boys and maids, snapping their fingers at them, abusing them over trivial matters, calling them for menial tasks they were well capable of doing themselves.\n\nI stated very loudly that firing the office boys over flimsy charges would lead to cases in the labour court, and the office boy was stunned to know that was even an option.\n\nThe arrogant buddhas huffed and puffed and complained to the head of the office, who called me in. Since I work for the Corporate office and don\'t report to him, he couldn\'t boss me around, so he told me to calm down and not "upset the seniors" in the company. He told me that office boys were used to being treated this way, since "it\'s part of their job".\n\nTo anyone still reading, please rid yourselves of this attitude. Office boys and maids are human beings, not servants*. They deserve the same respect, dignity, and kindness you expect from your company.\n\nPlease make an effort to know their names ("Arre, Suno" is not their name!!!!), talk to them once in a while, thank them when they make you a cup of tea, warm your food in the microwave, or come to your desk with some prasad or cake that some other colleague wishes to distribute in the office.\n\nWash your plates/containers/teacups after eating/drinking. Office is not a hotel, so it\'s not their duty to clean your utensils.\n\nIf you\'ve spilled something on your desk/floor and they have to clean it, apologise to them for the inconvenience. \n\nIf you have to stay back late for work, please take the office keys from them and offer to lock up the office yourself. They typically have to travel far to their home and have to report early to the office, so it\'s not fair for you to keep them waiting endlessly late in the day. Same for the Sundays when you have to report for duty.\n\nStand up for them if you see a colleague misbehaving or treating them callously. \n\nTLDR: Treat your office boys and maids like colleagues. Getting treated like shit is not part of their "job". Don\'t be a lazy slob and take care of minor things yourself in the office.\n\nThanks for reading, and apologies if I\'ve offended anyone. \n\n*Edit: Just to add, servants should also be treated with respect and dignity. \n\nEdit Edit: Thank you for the gold, generous redditor. Definitely appreciate the gesture, but honestly, I don\'t deserve gold for this rant/ post.',b'80toy3',b't3_80toy3',b'Request: Please treat your office boys and office maids with dignity and respect'

Science/Technology,1659,478,1547069393.0,0.97,iheartsubmariner,b'I am copying and pasting from a [comment I made in another thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/adu4hg/indias_massive_jio_carrier_is_blocking_vpn_sites/edkyke4/), after someone suggested that I should make a thread about this.\n\nJio is using\n\n1. Deep packet inspection\n2. Carrier-grade NAT\n3. Poorly configured stateful IPv6\n4. Almost completely locked down router with some non-sequitor options\n5. Clueless customer service, who just say "we can\'t talk about X or Y or Z" and who often do not even understand the question. If you ask about IPv6 settings, they\'ll say they can\'t help you, and then proceed to misinterpret it as a request for a static IP address. \n\nThe first two are reasons enough to not use this shitty ISP.\n\nTo explain in more detail:\n\n1. Every bit of data transmitted on the internet is transmitted as a packet. Think of this packet as a [matryoshka doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll). What Jio does is open these dolls to see what the innermost dolls look like. That obliterates your privacy. Jio is using software that is good enough to deny you service even if you use strong encryption. I believe that heuristic analysis and the use of known signatures is a part of the firewall.\n2. Before the days of IPv4 pool saturation, you would get a public IPv4 address (or even more than one) from your ISP, while your LAN would have a private IP address from a range reserved by the IETF (such as 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x). When these addresses became more scarce, ISPs moved to dynamic allocation, so unused addresses in their range would be recycled for other customers to use based on uptime. However, each customer still received a unique public IP address. Eventually, people decided that the principles used on large enterprise LANs could be applied to ISPs as well. On a service with CG-NAT, your public IP address is now shared with many other customers.\n * This is bad for several reasons, and performance and reliability are two of them. For instance, you could have trouble transmitting UDP packets across two routing tables. On a poorly configured network though, security is an even bigger concern, because you can expose multiple customer subnets to each other. The firewall on their router is a major cause for concern. The default is to allow all connections, rather than only established or related connections, while blocking others.\n3. IPv6 was introduced with the aim of mitigating the shortage of network addresses, and to also reduce the workload on network infrastructure, by changing the way addresses are assigned. I will not get into too much detail as I am no expert on IPv6 networking and haven\'t really messed around with it until I got Jio, but I can assure you that they are not following the guidelines or best practices for deploying IPv6.\n * For instance, WAN is assigned in a stateful manner, with only a /128 address being given to your router. Your LAN is by default configured to be stateless, with a /64 prefix length. However your LAN prefix is not assigned by the ISP, but is instead assigned from a reserved linked-local IPv6 range defined in an outdated RFC. So you literally get none of the benefits of IPv6, and all of the downsides of IPv4, as a NAT is involved in your connection.\n4. Bridging mode is completely broken. You still need to configure your WAN interface even when you want to bridge the Jio router to your own equipment.\n5. Jio\'s customer service is brain-dead retarded, and will simply refuse to help if you want anything more than basic troubleshooting. They also don\'t have any L2 or higher technicians available on the phone. Also, the best part is that their TSP and ISP divisions are separate, yet they seem to use the same customer care number! God help you if you call from your registered mobile number, because then you will be quickly connected to a human from one department, who will promptly refuse to look at issues involving the other department, and you will completely fail to connect to that particular department. They won\'t even transfer your call! Also when you use a non-registered number to get around this and provide them your registered mobile number, they have no means of identifying which service tickets belong to which department.\n * When I raised a complaint with the fiber department, and then called the jiofi department to register a separate complaint, the jiofi team would insist that the ticket was raised for jiofi, and when I raised a ticket with the jiofi team, the fiber team would insist that the ticket was raised for fiber!\n\nI will admit that I am still using the JioFi connection, but that is because I paid for a year of service, and that only gets used for things like netflix and amazon prime when I am on the move. It\'s not ideal, but I\'m kinda stuck with that one.',b'aeblpo',b't3_aeblpo',b"[R] Please don't get Jio Gigafiber, and I have several reasons to say so.

Usually I travel with friends/classmates but I had to stay back a few days so I'm on my own. \n\nAnyway, I was allotted a lower berth in 2nd ac. Perfect, I thought. I've got a bad back and climbing into the upper berth does it no favours. Things were going well till my berthmates arrived. \n\nIt's a family. A couple and 2 kids. They ask me if I can move to the upper berth to feed their kids and I can come back down after. I'm like ok, cool. I've travelled with kids before so I know how it can be. \n\nNope. After dinner, they put the kids to sleep. In my berth. Refusing to give it back. Ok, whatever. I'm not going to see them again after I get down. All good, right? \n\nNope. They've decided they want the entire fucking thing to themselves so they've been making life hell to get rid of me. Thankfully, I have a friend in another berth so I've been staying there but whenever I come back to get something or to lie down, they begin shouting, playing music, beating the kids (?!) until I leave. They woke me at 5 in the fucking morning blasting shitty music till I got up and left. \n\nThis is a seat that I've paid a fair bit of money for.

That gang was led by Susanta Chowdhury, a criminal under the umbrella of the local politicians. These criminals used to rape every young woman in the small village named Sutiya in West Bengal (2000 to 2002). Sometimes, they went to the house of a villager and raped the women inside the house, often in front of the whole family. They used to keep records of every little girl who became mature enough to rape. People who tried to protest were mercilessly butchered. No reports of rape and murder were allowed to be known to the police or media. \n\nBarun Biswas, a school teacher organized the villagers against these demons. He led the raped women to go to the police and media. The whole village came out to support the teacher in his fight for justice.\n\nAfter that there was a great media and public outrage which compelled the police to capture the criminals and bring them to justice. There were 33 rape cases and also 12 murder cases registered against them (the actual number of rapes were atleast 5 or 6 times more). The ring leader with his four main gang members were given life sentences. Some of the accused were released due to lack of evidence.\n\nIn 2002, Barun was shot dead by some of the freed members of that gang near Goboardanga railway station while returning from his school. He is a real hero and people of the area still revered him as a legend.\n\nEdit: Barun was shot dead in 2012.

This effectively prohibited pricing and technical discrimination as offered Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s Free Basics services. In 2018, TRAI further solidified net neutrality in its recommendations which the Department of Telecommunications adopted to make license amendments. However, there have been lasting concerns over the years that largely deal with lack of enforcement of these Rules. This brings us to the current day scenario where we have been witnessing rigorous website blocking by TSP/ISP\xe2\x80\x99s with no legal justification. We have been updating you in our previous [**posts**](https://internetfreedom.in/what-the-block-our-net-neutrality-rules-require-a-monitoring-and-enforcement-structure/) of these rampant occurrences.\n\n### "The Present and Future of Net Neutrality in India"\n\nThe Centre for Communication Governance at NLU Delhi and the Internet Freedom Foundation organised an engaging discussion on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Present and Future of Net Neutrality\xe2\x80\x9d this on March 14, 2019 (Thursday) at the India International Centre, Annexe. The reason behind organising such a gathering was to examine Net Neutrality\'s existing regulations and concerns but more importantly identify the necessary steps forward to protect the spirit and intent of net neutrality. The panellists comprised of experts from government, academia, civil society organisations and industry. Additionally, we have created a report summarising significant aspects of the discussion ([**Read here for more**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vCL0niT1AjiymaxLHHpibuitgCK2es_-/view?usp=sharing)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/kqy6wibu6hm21.png)\n\n### #SaveTheInternet\n\nAs we have explained, over the past few months, the Internet Freedom Foundation has focussed its efforts on identifying the violations of Net Neutrality through blocking of website access. It is in light of these current threats to net neutrality, it has taken the step to activate the [**SaveTheInternet.in**](https://savetheinternet.in/) website on March 18, 2019 at 8:00 AM.  \nThe website has been designed to move beyond email support for net neutrality to active petitioning. With a direct "[**Take Action Petition**](https://savetheinternet.in/petition/)" button, it provides individuals and organisations with the opportunity to show support to list of joint demands sent to the relevant government offices. We continue to make it possible for you to [**submit reports**](https://savetheinternet.in/report/) of any net neutrality violations to us.   \nHowever, the buck does not stop there. We at IFF will continue to monitor violations as we have and to the best of our abilities will ensure the spirit of Net Neutrality is maintained in India. Through this data we will be armed to take advocacy actions, make formal complaints and ensure TRAI and DOT enforce the necessary enforcement mechanisms.\n\n## All for one and one for all!

Raekha Prasad reports](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/sep/16/india.gender)\n\n> At 3pm on August 13 2004, Akku Yadav was lynched by a mob of around 200 women from Kasturba Nagar. It took them 15 minutes to hack to death the man they say raped them with impunity for more than a decade. Chilli powder was thrown in his face and stones hurled. As he flailed and fought, one of his alleged victims hacked off his penis with a vegetable knife. A further 70 stab wounds were left on his body. The incident was made all the more extraordinary by its setting. Yadav was murdered not in the dark alleys of the slum, but on the shiny white marble floor of Nagpur district court.\n\n> Laughed at and abused by the police when they reported being raped by Yadav, the women took the law into their own hands. A local thug, Yadav and his gang had terrorised the 300 families of Kasturba Nagar for more than a decade, barging into homes demanding money, shouting threats and abuse.\n\n> Residents say he murdered at least three neighbours and dumped their bodies on railway tracks. They had reported his crimes to the police dozens of times. Each time he was arrested, he was granted bail.\n\n> He violated women to control men, ordering his henchmen to drag even girls as young as 12 to a nearby derelict building to be gang-raped.\n\n>  Prominent among their supporters were 100 lawyers based in Nagpur who issued a statement saying the women should not be treated as the accused, but as the victims. \n\n> *One retired high court judge even congratulated the women. "In the circumstances they underwent, they were left with no alternative but to finish Akku. The women repeatedly pleaded with the police for their security. But the police failed to protect them," said Justice Bhau Vahane.*\n\n> On the day of Yadav\'s hearing, 200 women came to the court armed with vegetable knives and chilli powder. *As he walked in, Yadav spotted one of the women he had raped. He called her a prostitute and threatened to repeat the crime against her. The police laughed. She took off her sandal and began to hit him, shouting, "We can\'t both live on this Earth together. It\'s you or me."*\n\n-\n\nNov. \'14 - NDTV: [In Lynching of Alleged Rapist in Nagpur Court in 2004, All Accused Let Off](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/in-lynching-of-alleged-rapist-in-nagpur-court-in-2004-all-accused-let-off-691479)\n\n> A court in Maharashtra today *let off 21 people - including six women* - accused of murdering Akku Yadav, an alleged rapist, during a court hearing in 2004. \n\n\n\n-\n\nSpecial report from NDTV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3XPHUQXPcU\n\nDocumentary - Candles in the Wind: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dlW15DRCs8',b'bqu5mh',b't3_bqu5mh',b'TIL in 2004, around 200 women barged in a Nagpur district court with chilli powder and knives; his penis chopped off and Akku Yadav was lynched to death in front of the judge.

This afternoon a series of horrific events unfolded. I\'m going to try and summarise them here the best I can. Although parts are quite technical I urge to you stay informed, because this will undoubtedly affect your future as well as your country\'s future. \n\n**TL;DR** - The Chief Justice of India overruled some other judges and took over the hearing of a case in which there are allegations of corruption against him. This is a direct conflict of interest.\n\n\n\n**Background to the Case:** \n\n\n* Prashant Bhushan, a public interest activist and lawyer (he was one of those involved in uncovering the 2G scam) recently filed a suit before the SC. In that case, he claimed that there was corruption in the SC, in the form of people taking bribes in order to "fix" the outcomes of cases in the SC. Read the petition [here](https://barandbench.com/read-petition-kamini-jaiswal/), filed through a counsel, Ms. Kamini Jaiswal. \n* The petition contains serious allegations of corruption against a number of people including the current Chief Justice of India, Justice Dipak Misra. \n(edit: in case you forgot, Justice Dipak Misra is the subject of this article, which brought up allegations of corruption against him before he became Chief Justice: [Should a judge with a serious moral flaw become Chief Justice of India?](https://thewire.in/163957/dipak-misra-chief-justice-of-india-land-allotment-case/))\n* The case came up before Justice Chelameswar and Justice Abdul Nazeer, after a senior advocate, Mr. Dushyant Dave, [urged them to take notice of it](https://barandbench.com/dave-chelameswar-sc-judges/). Under the Constitution, some significant questions have to be heard by a bench of 5 judges or more and not the usual 2 or 3 judges. So they directed the matter to be heard by 5 judges, excluding the Chief Justice, obviously, since allegations are there against him. The hearing was supposed to be on Monday. \nRead about the court proceedings [here](https://barandbench.com/bribe-sc-judges-constitution-bench/). \n\n**What happened today:** \n\n* The Chief Justice, ignoring the order passed by the other judges, constituted a bench of 7 judges himself. 2 of them recused (i.e. refused to participate, which they are allowed to do mainly on grounds of conflict of interest). So now a different 5 judge bench is hearing the matter that the original bench should have heard. Why is this important? It is extremely unusual to constitute two benches on one case, in fact I don\'t think it has been done before. \n* The Chief Justice\'s 5 judge bench heard the case concerning allegations of corruption against himself!!! \n* Senior members of the bar association, instead of supporting the petition and protesting against this, called for contempt of court actions against Prashant Bhushan and Kamini Jaiswal. Contempt of court is a criminal offence and is quite serious. Clearly an attempt to silence them. Some senior advocate wanted to ban any reporting on the case as well (they were unsuccessful). \n* The Chief Justice, without giving clear reasons, passed an order prohibiting the other bench from hearing this case, and held that his bench would hear it instead. It will be heard after 2 weeks. \n* Meanwhile, there was an attempt to arrest Prashant Bhushan for contempt of court, but he walked out of court before they could get him. He said that he had not been allowed to speak or argue his case for 1 hour before that. \n\n[Here](https://twitter.com/vikramhegde/status/928920830116904960) is a twitter thread by a lawyer from the Court, reporting live on the case. \n\n**Why does it matter?** \n\n* It implies that the Chief Justice can effectively stop any allegations of corruption against itself by refusing to let anyone else hear the matter. This is very significant for corruption, and also in light of the fact that the current government is trying hard through the NJAC to take control of who becomes a Supreme Court judge. \n* It shows that the Supreme Court itself is a house divided, and that we cannot rely on it as an institution to protect us against corruption. \n\n\nBe informed, and pay close attention. This is going to be very significant. \n\n**How to stay informed?** \n\nPrashant Bhushan\'s [twitter](https://twitter.com/pbhushan1) and his [website](http://judicialreforms.org/) for legal reform and accountability. \nLegal news reporters and websites: [Bar and Bench](https://barandbench.com/), [Legally India](https://www.legallyindia.com/), [LiveLaw](http://www.livelaw.in/), [Murali Krishnan](https://twitter.com/legaljournalist) (Bar and Bench reporter\'s twitter), [Utkarsh Anand \\(](https://twitter.com/utkarsh_aanand)legal reporter CNN India, twitter),[ Ashok Bagariya](https://twitter.com/ashokbagariya) (legal editor, HT) ,\n\n\nI am not in the least involved with this case, but I am following it closely from an academic perspective.

Read the last 3\\-4 paragraphs if you have no time.\n\nI had to bring this up someplace, where it could get some traction. It could also serve to forewarn other prospective customers about Quikr\'s shoddy practices. I\'ll detail my ordeal in a timeline manner in order to make it more readable. Apologies for the length.\n\n**Sequence of events**\n\n**April 23** \\- I placed an ad to sell my Samsung 318L refridgerator on Quikr with AD ID 307242735.\n\n**May 30** \\- Received an offer of 20,000 INR. The buyer called me to confirm the offer, I accepted and buyer promptly makes payment to Quikr. The arrangement is Quikr Doorstep will hold the money, pick the product up from my doorstep, deliver it to the buyer\'s doorstep and then once buyer signs off, transfer the money to me.\n\n**May 31** \\- I schedule a pickup in the 4\\-6pm slot. Quikr driver calls me at 12 and asks to pick it up. I\'m at work so ask him to stick to the slot. *Red flag 1:* He calls again at 3 and says he\'s already at my address and if I don\'t enable pick up then, he will drive away. I rush home and make it happen. The condition of the fridge at pick up is [here](https://imgur.com/a/W2u1fxM), [here](https://imgur.com/a/hXGccRH) & [here](https://imgur.com/a/qiOoYgg).\n\n**June 1** \\- Buyer has scheduled drop off in the 12\\-2pm slot. Quikr calls to tell him his area is not serviceable as per their doorstep delivery model, so they cannot drop it there. *Red flag 2:* They gave no such hint to the buyer when he was making payment. Buyer then agrees to come to their furthest serviceable point close to his residence (7km away) with his own truck to pick it up. Delivery rescheduled for June 5 in the 10am\\-12pm slot.\n\n**June 5** \\- Buyer reaches spot with truck, combines this pick up with a few other purchases. Truck has cost him 1200 INR. *Red flag 3:* Quikr vehicle fails to arrive in the slot. Buyer waits until 2pm and customer care says the vehicle had broken down. Asks him to wait until 5. Buyer is frustrated and finally cancels purchase around 4pm. I contact buyer and hear about this, call customer care and they say they can do nothing now but return the product since buyer has already refused to accept it on the app.\n\n**June 6** \\- Return is initiated for 10am\\-12pm. I take work from home to facilitate this. *Red flag 4:* Product doesn\'t arrive even until 1pm so I call customer care and they quote "operational issues" and that product will be delivered by EOD. Don\'t receive any update until 7pm so call the same cusomer service rep and he promises it will be there in the next 1 hour. Call again at 9 and he says "operational issues" are still ongoing so it can only be returned tomorrow.\n\n**June 7** \\- Return scheduled again for 10am\\-12pm. This time I took sick leave, as I can\'t WFH more than once a week. *Red flag 5:* Product arrives at 10:45am with dents on the freezer side as seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/Tmo4Pzy). Wife and I are absolutely devastated, hold the truck, refuse to accept the return, call the logistics guy who meekly apologizes and says he can maybe pay 1000 for the damage. After an hour on the phone with him, he agrees reluctantly to 5000 as damage, but asks his truck driver to get back to the warehouse as we refuse to let it enter the house without the money in hand. We started ranting all over their social media pages, finally one person from the SM team calls me to say Quikr\'s policy allows only a compensation up to 5\\-10&#37; of the buyer\'s agreed purchase price. We tell her that the logistics guy agreed for 5000, she speaks to him and he denies ever agreeing this. After 3 hours of fighting over phone, they finally agree to 4000. We write a detailed mail with all damages listed and inform that we agree to this compensation only under protest, and that we don\'t admit that this is the right amount for damage caused. Return is scheduled for June 11, and the SM person agrees with us that we will once again check for other damages and then a final compensation over and above 4000 will be agreed upon delivery, if more damages are found. Return is scheduled for June 11, 7\\-10am.\n\n**June 11** \\- Another day we had to skip work as Quikr failed on its return by 10am, changed the slot to 12\\-2pm without consulting us, and did not even inform us. We had to call customer care to learn this. We wait until 3pm and call the SM person, who says there are "operational issues" again (quelle surprise) and she will get it delivered by EOD. Fridge doesn\'t arrive by EOD (quelle surprise, again).\n\n**June 12**\\- Start the fire fight early and the entire day was spent on calls & emails with the SM person who again quotes "operational issues". Finally at 5pm, she says the fridge will arrive in 1 hour and the logistics team will call us. Got a call from the logistics person, who said the fridge will arrive before 1130pm. Which person in their right mind will let in strangers to their house at 1130pm? We refuse to take the return if it is done after 9pm. *Red flag 6:* It arrives at 8:45pm and to our utter horror, note further dents as seen on the [door](https://imgur.com/a/8OTgEtv), [side](https://imgur.com/a/N119Dkl) and the [front door](https://imgur.com/a/pTu0F46). We decide to accept it since the SM person had already promised the 4000 for damages noted on June 7, and agreed to compensate for further damages.\n\n**June 13** \\- We write a detailed email at 9am with all images of dents/damages to SM person and seek further compensation. *Red flag** 7*: No response. I call customer care at 3:45 pm and ask for her, they say she will call me in 2 hours. No call until 6:15pm so i call again and this time demand to speak. Her colleague comes on line and says we will definitely get the 4000 but she does not commit to a time line or anything more. I ask her to make a confirmation of this payment at least by EOD, as well as ask the SM person to call me before EOD.\n\n**June 14 (today)** \\- No response, as expected, from the SM person or any other Quikr rep. I have posted ads on other websites/Facebook and contacted local people to buy the fridge now in its present condition, and I am not getting offers for anything more than 8\\-9k.\n\n**Next step** \\- We are considering pursuing legal action. My wife is a lawyer and we don\'t want to let go of this.\n\n**Request** \\- I would really appreciate it if you guys could tweet this at Quikr/other social media influencers and increase visibility for me. Here is my Tweet linking to this post which you can retweet/share - https://twitter.com/arvindhram924/status/1007114521712910336?s=19\n\n**Warning** \\- If you are considering Quikr doorstep, reconsider. If you are considering selling a product on an online marketplace, reconsider. Never let your product leave your door without cash in hand or money in the bank. It\'s not your responsibility what happens to it after it leaves your door, but in this case, as we learnt it the hard way, the burden is all back on us.\n\n**Final word** \\- Quikr run their scam at the mercy of unsuspecting customer, and it is no wonder that their CEO Pranay Chulet is inactive on Twitter since 2012. They\'ve made it extremely hard to find email IDs of their people that matter so all our communication has been with a lowly social media executive. They are a shady, shady business that I hope soon goes bust. Eat shit, you guys.\n\n**TLDR:** Quikr took our fridge for delivery on 31 May, did not deliver on time so buyer refused, damaged it in the process, agreed a partial compensation, delayed the return to me, damaged it further, finally returned, now they are dragging their feet on the even the agreed partial compensation. Our fridge has gone through incredible torment in Quikr\'s hands for 14 days, and we have gone through no less on an emotional/financial basis. Quikr\'s business is reliant on deceit and lies, shoddy delivery practices, and complete miscommunication between their own teams. Dishonesty in Indian e\\-commerce is not too uncommon, but this is a level that takes the fucking cake.\n\nUpdate - Quikr offered to pay the full price of the product as agreed by the buyer and asked me for the fridge in return. That\'s just insulting. After all this hassle and torture, we get only the price of the fridge back? We\'re going to court, folks. Legal notice going out tonight. Wish us luck!',b'8qyqem',b't3_8qyqem',b'[RANT] Quikr is sham and I wait for the day it goes up in flames'

I was born in Pakistan, but I was raised in the US before returning back to Pakistan just shy of my 13th birthday. My family is mostly military as well and includes many high-ranking military officials. \n\nThe recent attacks in Pulwama has disgusted my family and I beyond belief. The Pakistani people are not like this usually. The ISI is an independent organization, which as many of you know, works outside of the law. They committed this heinous act. Not us. A minority of the Pakistani people may support this attack, but remember that they are only a minority. Pakistan has suffered greatly from terrorism, just as much as you have, which can be shown by the fact we have lost more than 50,000 men, women, and children to terrorism. Now, the everyday Pakistani should not have to suffer for the acts of an independent organization. So before you urge your leaders to declare war, before you raise your rifles, remember that we're sorry.\n\nThis was an attack meant to spread hate. However, if you truly oppose this cowardly act then don't buy into the hate please. If you want to be bigger country, if you truly want to be the better person, urge your leaders to take this to the UN and urge them to hold those leaders and politicians who ordered this attack accountable. War benefits no one in the end. Thank you.\n\nEdit: AoA. I feel as though I should clarify a couple of things. I am a patriot for my country, I love Pakistan and I hope that Pakistan thrives in the future. At the same time, I love our military, but it's due to this love that I feel as though it's let us down. The ISI was supposed to make us feel safe, it was supposed to be the agency which acted on the behalf of the Pakistani people. I think the ISI thinks it is acting on the behalf of Pakistan, but it fails to recognize the fact that sponsoring terrorism isn't the only way to establish a geopolitical presence in IOK and Afghanistan. Our military is mostly composed of those that live Pakistan as well, most of our Armed Forces are true patriots. The enlisted men, the officers, they are all great people, but it's those that occupy the high positions, which manipulate information and organize these acts which anger me.

In addition to that they have blurred any instances of nudity. \n\nThey are setting an extremely dangerous precedent by being a willing participant in censoring content. This is the wet dream of the government of India and other countries where the state wants censorship but do not have the resources to implement it on their own. [This comes at a time when Holloywood is bending over backwards to appease the Chinese censor board\\(SAPPRFT\\)](http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/05/18/407619652/how-chinas-censors-influence-hollywood).     \n\nAs someone who is involved in fighting against censorship, this is a serious blow as I see the rest of the industry following suit. \n\nIndia is still a small market for Amazon, but it needs to know that there are many who oppose any form of censorship by principle. I hope people in the west notice how their companies behave if they see potential to make some extra money.',b'5ko5tu',b't3_5ko5tu',b'Amazon Prime video is censoring content and the world needs to take notice'

No one is even talking about "Make in India" or creating jobs. \n\nIt\'s basically fear mongering and Hindu nationalism. Which is strange because India isn\'t under attack, nor is it threatened by anything for BJP to say "Bharat khatre mein hain" (India is in danger).\n\nI don\'t want to live in a country like this.

Non-Political,1014,155,1480145655.0,0.91,hfsyou,b'I had around RS. 300 in my freecharge account as of 24 November, 2016.\n\n  On 24 November me and 3 other redditors from r/IndianGaming decided to buy 4-pack Rocket league PC game from Steam sale. Here is the thread - https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianGaming/comments/5elbao/anyone_interested_in_buying_rocket_league/\nIt costed Rs. 180 for each of us.\n\n  I sent them the game as a gift on steam and they sent me RS.180 via freecharge. It was all good and happy. Now total balance around Rs. 650.\n\n  On November 25, when I try to access my freecharge account via my android phone, it shows a notification saying your account has been "temporarily banned" and for further information contact "care@freecharge.com". I go ahead and email them asking for the reason for why it was banned and to unblock it asap.\n\n  Today, 26 November, I receive a mail saying - \n  >Dear XYZ,\n\n>Thank you for writing in.\n\n>We understand that you are unable to use the FreeCharge account. \n\n>As per our records account has been blocked due to security reasons & cannot be unblocked further. \n\n\n>However, if you have any general balance in your FreeCharge wallet, the same would be refunded to the same source (Sender\'s account) which was used to load money into your Freecharge account. \n\n>Refund amount will reflect in your source (bank account/card) within 7 to 10 working days as per bank norms.\n\n>Do write to us for any further queries.\n\n>Happy FreeCharging,\n>Customer Success Team\n\n\n  Wow, brilliant. I\'m not even sure what half of it means. Will the freecharge account of redditors from r/IndianGaming receive a refund for Rs. 180? Or will their bank/CC receive it.\n\n  Now the initial Rs. 300 I had was a part of RS. 500 that was sent to me by my friend ABC who had added money to his wallet from his friend PQR who had a credit card. I don\'t have one. I had transferred some part of 500 to my brother\'s account, where he used a part of it and returned back the other part.\n\nNow I\'m not sure If my friend ABC will receive a refund or will his friend PQR will receive the refund. Don\'t even know if either of them will receive a refund.\n\n  Being angry af, I started searching for similar issues on google. Many people have faced the same problem of their account being banned and no reason being given to them. \n\n   After some more research, I found that rooted phone was a common theme. I\'m not sure if this is the exact reason or not. But somewhere a person who created a second account on his rooted dual sim phone (After his first account was banned) had his new account blocked in seconds. My OnePlus 2 has been rooted from day 1. I\'ve had freecharge installed since 3 months now. Also how does my phone being rooted matter?\n\n  Lastly, Snapdeal bought Freecharge for $400 million. That amount of money and you don\'t have a f*cking toll free number. Forget toll free number, at least a normal number where I can call them. Or at least live chat. They reply to emails every 24 hour. \n\n  Now even If I get all of my money back, this is some next level of shit and I\'m never using freecharge again. Also, If I don\'t, is there something I can do about it? Experienced redditors, help me pls file a consumer complain against them.\n\n\n**Freecharge, fuck you! Also, as many redditors have pointed out, freecharge usually has shitty customer service and my case is not an exception.**\n\n\n\n  **Also remember to share this with people who have ROOTED android phones and have started using freecharge after demonetisation.**\n\n**EDIT**: Other threads calling out snapdeal/freecharge for fraud:\n\n\n1. https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4z1viu/freecharge_wallet_scam/\n2. https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/59c8ky/np_the_snapdeal_quality_check_scam/\n\n**EDIT 2**: Just found out about a loophole where one can login into a freecharge account without being needed to enter the OTP. Now, I\'m no cyber security expert, but it seems like by installing an old Freecharge apk from one of these sites, you don\'t need to enter the otp.\n\n  This is ridiculous. This [site](http://www.jonomus.net/coupon/freecharge-trick-earn-unlimted-recharge/]) explains how simple it is. Okay, I\'m not getting everything about it but there are about 100 sites like this. WTF $400 million freecharge is doing about this? Is this a joke?\n\n**EDIT 3**: Damn, this blew up. Number of upvotes on this post is more than my loss. Some relief lol.\n\n**EDIT 4**: Seems like many redditors were also banned for unknown reasons and their queries were never answered. Freecharge twitter/facebook has not replied to me yet. I haven\'t even received a reply to my email sent 10 hours ago. They really do reply only once in 24 hours. I still can\'t comprehend this.\n\n**EDIT 5**:Great news, both u/rebelsoul94 and u/not_the_irrelevant have confirmed they\'ve re received the refund in their accounts, though without any notifications. They\'ll send it to me again later in  another account, which I will use in 34 milliseconds.  **Still no idea about the other Rs. 300**. Neither my friend ABC nor his friend PQR have received any refund.',b'5eyfsg',b't3_5eyfsg',b'PSA : Freecharge can block your account for "security reasons" without giving any explanation. There is no way to unblock your account and use your money. Account of users with a rooted android phone seems to be a common element. Avoid freecharge at all cost.'

Non-Political,984,348,1431488495.0,0.94,rarebrewer,b'Background:\n\nBefore 1971, Bangladesh used to be a part of Pakistan as East Pakistan. According to Najam Sethi, a well respected and honoured journalist from Pakistan, East Pakistan always complained that they received less development funds and less attention from the West Pakistan (Punjabi) dominating government. Bengalis in East Pakistan also resisted the adoption of Urdu as the state language. The revenue from export, whether it was from the Cotton of West Pakistan or Jute of East Pakistan, was handled mainly by West Pakistan. Lastly, in an election conducted just some months before the war, the victory was gained by the East Pakistani leader and still he was not given the power, thus fueling the movement in East Pakistan.\n\nPakistani army started its operation in East Pakistan to contain the movement and anger among the Bengalis. It is reported that the army was involved in mass killing of public and mass rape of women. India was aware of this and was only waiting for a trigger to start the war. India started receiving huge number of refugees which became unmanageable, pushing it to intervene in the situation. The situation soon attracted the attention of many other countries. Thus the war later was not only between India and Pakistan, but many countries were involved in 1971 Indo Pakistani war (War of Liberation of Bangladesh) directly or indirectly.\n\nIn May, Indira Gandhi wrote to Nixon about the \xe2\x80\x98carnage in East Bengal\xe2\x80\x99 and the flood of refugees, burdening India. After L K Jha (then the Indian ambassador to US) had warned Kissinger that India might have to send back some of the refugees as guerrillas, Nixon commented, \xe2\x80\x98By God, we will cut off economic aid [to India].\xe2\x80\x99\n\nA few days later, when the US president said \xe2\x80\x98the goddamn Indians\xe2\x80\x99 were preparing for another war, Kissinger retorted \xe2\x80\x98they are the most aggressive goddamn people around.\n\nUS and China Connection, A Little Known Fact\n(All Excerpts and Sources from 929 page long Volume XI of the Foreign Relations of the United States)\n\nUS sympathized with Pakistan, because of various reasons. Among them two reasons were that: firstly, Pakistan belonged to American led military Pact, CENTO and SEATO; secondly, US believed any victory of India will be considered as the expansion of Soviet influence in the parts gained by India with the victory, as it was believed to be a pro Soviet nation, even though they were non aligned.\n\nIn a telegram sent (famously know as the Blood Telegram) to US Secretary of State Will Roger, on March 28, 1971, the staff of the US consulate in Dhaka complained, \xe2\x80\x98Our government has failed to denounce the suppression of democracy. Our government has failed to denounce atrocities. Our government has failed to take forceful measures to protect its citizens while at the same time bending over backwards to placate the West Pakistan dominated government\xe2\x80\xa6 We, as professional public servants express our dissent with current policy and fervently hope that our true and lasting interests here can be defined and our policies redirected in order to salvage our nation\xe2\x80\x99s position as a moral leader of the free world.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThis brought China in the picture. US needed help from China and the messenger was Pakistan. US  approached China very secretly on this issue, who was more than welcoming as it believed that their relations with US could improve from this onward.\n\nDuring the second week of July, 1971, Kissinger arrived in Beijing, where he heard the words by then Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai: \xe2\x80\x9cIn our opinion, if India continues on its present course in disregard of world opinion, it will continue to go on recklessly. We, however, support the stand of Pakistan. This is known to the world. If they [the Indians] are bent on provoking such a situation, then we cannot sit idly by.\xe2\x80\x99 On this, Kissinger responded that China should know that the US also backs Pakistan on this issue.\n\nIndira Gandhi, the Indian prime minister in those times decided to tour most of the Western capitals to prove Indian stand and gain support and sympathy for the Bengalis of East Pakistan. On November 4th and 5th she met Nixon in Washington. Nixon straight forwardly told her that a new war in the subcontinent was out of the question.\n\nThe next day, Nixon and Kissinger assessed the situation. Kissinger told Nixon: \xe2\x80\x98The Indians are bastards anyway. They are plotting a war.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThe pressure increased in East Pakistan, which attracted Indian attention. Indians were preparing for war and were concentrated on the Eastern front. To divert the pressure, on December 3, in the dark of night, even before India could attack East Pakistan, Pakistan opened western front and air raided six Indian Airfields in Kashmir and Punjab.\n\nThe CIA reported to the US President that Indian Prime Minister believes that the Chinese will never intervene militarily in North India, and thus, any action from China would be a surprise for India and Indian military might collapse in tensed situation caused by fighting in three different fronts (East, North and West).\n\nHearing this, on December 9, Nixon decided to send the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise into the Bay of Bengal to threaten India. The plan was to Surround India from all four sides and force them to retreat and leave East Pakistan.\n\nOn December 10, Nixon instructed Kissinger to ask the Chinese to move some troops toward the Indian frontier. \xe2\x80\x98Threaten to move forces or move them, Henry, that\xe2\x80\x99s what they must do now.\xe2\x80\x99 China feared any action on India might attract Soviet aggression. At this, US assured China that any action taken by Soviet Union will be countered by US to protect China.\n\nBritain and Soviet Confrontation\nConfidential \xe2\x80\x93 The Commander of the Military Intelligence Service Gen. Pyotr Ivashutin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Soviet Intelligence has reported that the English operative connection has come nearer to territorial India, water led by an aircraft carrier \xe2\x80\x9cEagle\xe2\x80\x9d [On December 10]. For helping friendly India, Soviet government has directed a group of ships under the command of admiral V. Kruglyakov.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVladimir Kruglyakov, the former (1970-1975) Commander of the 10th Operative Battle Group (Pacific Fleet) remembers:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was ordered by the Chief Commander to track the British Navy\xe2\x80\x99s advancement, I positioned our battleships in the Bay of Bengal and watched for the British carrier \xe2\x80\x9cEagle\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nBut Soviet Union didn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough force to resist if they encountered the British Carrier. Therefore, to support the existing Soviet fleet in the Bay of Bengal, Soviet cruisers, destroyers and nuclear submarines, equipped with anti ship missiles, were sent from Vladivostok.\n\nIn reaction English Navy retreated and went South to Madagascar.\n\nSoon the news of American carrier Enterprise and USS Tripoli\xe2\x80\x99s advancement towards Indian water came.\n\nV. Kruglyakov \xe2\x80\x9c I had obtained the order from the commander-in-chief not to allow the advancement of the American fleet to the military bases of India\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn an interview to a Russian TV programme after his retirement, Admiral Kruglyakov, who commanded the Pacific Fleet from 1970 to 1975, recalled that Moscow ordered the Russian ships to prevent the Americans and British from getting closer to \xe2\x80\x9cIndian military objects\xe2\x80\x9d. The genial Kruglyakov added: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Chief Commander\xe2\x80\x99s order was that our submarines should surface when the Americans appear. It was done to demonstrate to them that we had nuclear submarines in the Indian Ocean. So when our subs surfaced, they recognised us. In the way of the American Navy stood the Soviet cruisers, destroyers and atomic submarines equipped with anti-ship missiles. We encircled them and trained our missiles at the Enterprise. We blocked them and did not allow them to close in on Karachi, Chittagong or Dhaka."\n\nThe Soviet ships had small range rockets (only upto 300 KM). Therefore, to hold the opponent under the range, commanders ran risks of going as near to the enemy as possible.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Chief Commander had ordered me to lift the submarines and bring them to the surface so that it can be pictured by the American spy satellites or can be seen by the American Navy!\xe2\x80\x99 It was done to demonstrate, that we had all the needed things in Indian Ocean, including the nuclear submarines. I had lifted them, and they recognized it. Then, we intercepted the American communication. The commander of the Carrier Battle Group was then the counter-admiral Dimon Gordon. He sent the report to the 7th American Fleet Commander: \xe2\x80\x98Sir, we are too late. There are Russian nuclear submarines here, and a big collection of battleships\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nAmericans returned and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything. Soviet Union had also threatened China that, if they ever opened a front against India on its border, they will receive a tough response from North.\n\nThe war ended with the surrender of Pakistani army as they missed American help due to quick Russians who blocked both America and China from preventing India to advance. With this, a new country named Bangladesh was formed, which was recognized by the whole world and by Pakistan in the following year with Shimla Agreement.\n\nSource:\n\nhttp://www.rediff.com/news/2006/dec/26claude.htm\n\nhttp://www.theworldreporter.com/2011/10/1971-india-pakistan-war-role-of-russia.html\n\nhttp://in.rbth.com/articles/2011/12/20/1971_war_how_russia_sank_nixons_gunboat_diplomacy_14041.html\n\nAlso worth noting is that China (An supposedly all weather friend, etc....) did absolutely nothing to protect Pakistan...\n\nEDIT: Wow, my first gold.
