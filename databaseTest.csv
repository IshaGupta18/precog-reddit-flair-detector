Politics,1152,221,1523606785.0,0.89,spooreddit,b"This is going to be a rant, so please bear with me. Prior to 2014 elections, I hated Congress just like most people in India did at that time (I didn't vote for BJP, voted for one of the Dravidian parties). I always knew the change was inevitable because people would obviously be bored of Congress irrespective of what they do and BJP would come to power in 2014. But irrespective of all those alleged scams and corruptions, I never felt anything wrong about India or felt unsafe. I always thought we were democratic and corruption is something that would always happen and could be eradicated with stricter laws. But once BJP had come to power, corruption seemed to be a trivial issue. There's a kind of unsafe atmosphere in India. Right-wing Hindus always play victim games, like how a constant force (the Vatican) is always at work 24/7 to break India and Hindus, while it is the minorities (Muslims and Dalits) who have been persecuted the most after 2014. Tamil Dalit leader Thol.Thirumavalan precisely put out that, if one's offered to choose between corruption and communalism, one should always choose the former and not the latter for there's no guarantee that communalism coated with developmental politics will develop the country. Demonetisation, GST, Aadhar, 15th finance commision, Beef control - everything done in the name of development has only destroyed the country. You could wonder if there was no caste killings or communalism priot to 2014. There were. But the government officials or the self proclaimed nationalists did not defend those activities. Most people now fear these actives could be state sponsored or the state takes no action against them and the attacks are being normalized like they always happen.  BJP has made me, a born Hindu, hate the word Hindu. I am not exactly sure why I am ranting like this or the point of this rant. The thoughts are not even coherent, but spare me I wanted to post them somewhere. I seriously hope fellow Indians make a better decision in 2019. \n\nTL;DR - Until Congress was in power, I hated Congress. Once BJP has come to power, I kind of started hating fellow Indians and the Indian states that voted BJP to power.",b'8bxj9w',b't3_8bxj9w',b'I hated Congress, because of their UPA 2 scams.

My village sits right on the Kodai foothills and till the year 2000, our only source of water was a river that ran through the village. The river ran very close to the Ponds factory.\n\nI have since 2001 been seeing an exponential death rate due to cancer. I myself lost my Grandmom to cancer in 2004, my tiny village of around 5,000 people has seen about 250 cancer deaths in just the past 5 years. That is a 5% mortality rate just from cancer. India has by comparision a 0.05% mortality rate. In other words my village has a 8500% greater mortality rate from cancer as compared the nation at large. \n\nIf you factor in other variables like lifestyle caused cancer like Lung cancer because of smoking, and the fact that the vast majority of the 250 dead had none of these (or exposure to pollution for that matter) habits the numbers would look worse.\n\nI want to bring this to the attention of somebody. I am not even looking at a case or a payout or anything, but just to bring this to some form of limelight. Do I just spam media outlets with an email, or should I contact GP / other NGO\'s...ideas are welcome.\n\nFurther studies in case you are interested.\n\n[Studies and Reports on environmental pollution and public health hazard caused by Hindustan Lever in Kodaikanal](http://www.sipcotcuddalore.com/Kodaikanal/studies.htm). \n\n[Berijam lake](http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Blog/Guest-blog/hanging-in-the-mist-mercury-contamination-in-/blog/47184/).\n\n>>Moss samples collected from trees surrounding the Berijam Lake, located 20 km from the factory, were also tested. Mercury levels were in the range of 0.2 \xc2\xb5g/kg, while in Kodaikanal Lake the lichen and moss levels were 7.9 \xc2\xb5g/kg and 8.3 \xc2\xb5g/kg, respectively. Fish samples from the Kodaikanal Lake also showed mercury levels in the range of 120 to 290 mg/kg.\n\n>>The fish in Kodaikanal Lake are contaminated, and this has caused the loss of livelihood for many people. Water as far as Madurai, a major city about 130kms from Kodaikanal, has been contaminated. That\'s no surprise because the contaminated water from the mountains was bound to flow onto the plains below.\n\nThis article talks about a town 130 Km\'s away and one that has no direct linkage to it via any river. My village is 20 kms from Berijam (about 50 km\'s by road), and the river in question, the [Varaha](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/varaha-river-to-flow-unimpeded/article2661510.ece) originated in Berijam. We are upstream, one of the first major settlements on the river, so the pollution and sewage that eventually killed the river really didn\'t matter to us. \n\nEdit - Throwaway for obvious reasons. Don\'t want this post to be sidetracked by petty partisanship.\n\nedit 2 - Guys, have received PM\'s from Timesnow. Livemint has contacted the mods, and the mods have provided me a contact id. I have also been contacted (via) PM of an international NGO that looks into such cases.\n\nTo be honest I never expected this kind of traction and it is kind of scary now, but I am going to go ahead and email these three entities whatever info it is they require as well as put them onto people in my village.\n\nedit 3 : 6th June 2015, 1300 IST - Guys,  I have initiated contact with 3 Indian Media outlets (big names) who reached out to me. I am now going to go by what they recommend next.\n\nI will keep this thread updated as and when there is a d4evelopment. I have also been approached by 3 reddit users who kindly offered me their labs to test if I need so, but right now, I only have sketchy data to go by (as others here have pointed). I am going to co-operate with the media names and first see if something comes up via their more extensive due diligence.\n\nThank you. Just to reassure you (that I am not misusing the goodwill of the forum) the issue is real, maybe the cause is not mercury directly, but something is poisoning my village and my post was and remains well intentioned and not a "troll post" as a few have alleged via PM.',b'38heyu',b't3_38heyu',b'Help, ideas needed.

Long post but hopefully you\xe2\x80\x99ll find some inspiration at the end of it.\n\n- I dropped out of engineering myself, you can check my post history to a couple of years or so ago. I dropped out of engineering in my third year at pretty good college. Restarted it in my second year when my parents refused to fund any other discipline of education. I did my engineering at a shit private college. I was sad and depressed too and all I did was come home, sleep, pass the day, etc. fast forward to today, I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent a year at top 3 International university after being invited, and I\xe2\x80\x99m heading to Estonia for my masters, completely free and even a decent stipend to take care of my expenses there. It was a long journey, but I struggled like the rest of you. \n\n\n- **To all of you who are depressed, unmotivated and in bed all day, I would recommend doing something as simple as taking a shower**. A warm/cold shower (however you prefer) is so underrated and can help you just get ready enough to do do something more, or at least get you out of bed. There have been so many times that my feeling of \xe2\x80\x98bleh what a day\xe2\x80\x99 turned around after a shower.\n\n\n- **Cut out the porn and the jerking off. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to push you into a deeper hole without making you realise that it\xe2\x80\x99s happening at all**.\nMasturbation is fine, so is porn. Just don\xe2\x80\x99t indulge to pass the time is all.\n\n\n- **Small achievements can go a long way. Try and learn how to make a nice omelette for yourself. Re-arrange your cupboard maybe? Re-order your bookshelf? Clean the dirt off your shoes? Water your plants? Any of these is something positive you did for yourself or your household. Congratulations. **\n\n\n- Depression is very complicated, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no fix all solution as there are infinite reasons that can lead you to this road. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try and address those who feel unproductive or feel they can\xe2\x80\x99t do much professionally or education wise:\n\n- **A lot of the times, we get depressed because of conflict in fulfilling what\xe2\x80\x99s expected of us and what we actually want to do, my only advice is this: Everyone dies**. **Yes, taking up a job which isn\xe2\x80\x99t mainstream might seem embarrassing in the moment, maybe your parents are upset or worst case disown you. But we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about getting you out of the mindset to take your life or wasting it away.**\n**You may push yourself to do something that people/parents or society want but not you, then everyone will die, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be stuck with your choice for 30-40 years, unhappy. **\nI\xe2\x80\x99d rather you risk 5-7 years of discomfort, take a risk, or start at the bottom somewhere and grow and learn. Get beyond the confines of the education system if you suck at it. Live life on your own terms. \n\n- Also, It helps no one if you want to be a high paid exec but spend your day binging Brooklyn 99 or reruns of Big Bang Theory. __Either adjust your dreams to your effort or your effort to your dreams. A disconnect will only get you down further.__\n\n- Story time: A friend of mine, girl, ran away from her house after she was verbally and physically abused by her family for not getting a job. She was 23 at that time. She had around 19k in savings, walked around and found a job as a night desk attendant after a week in a local chain hotel reception. She managed to find a place to stay with 5 other people in a very (VERY) small flat, so she could pay less rent, she ate shit food and lived in shit conditions, but she learned and grew on the job, by waiting tables and cleaning and doing additional duties. She grew and now she\xe2\x80\x99s managing the hotel and running a bar owned by the owner of the chain on her own and earning more than most people I know at 28-29. This woman would call me almost everyday depressed and crying, to see her where she is now makes me very happy.\n\n- **So yeah, her family hated her, her relatives hated her for being a receptionist** and a dishwasher and a waitress, she risked A LOT for 6-7 years, but she decided to work her ass off out of that situation. \n\n- **Doing productive work isn\xe2\x80\x99t too hard. You just need some momentum. Try and have no zero days. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a shit ton of work piled up, resolve to do some portion of it.**\n\n- Do enough that the future you (of tomorrow, of next week, of next month) can thank the past you for being an awesome bro/sis and doing your part of the load. So no zero productivity days. Feel free to DM. \n\n**PS: Redditors can at the very most sympathise with you and tell you that everything is going to be okay. Very few would be more generous than words of support. Everyone will move on with their life and in the end, it\xe2\x80\x99s only you and your hustle. Solution takes time and you\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be out of the rut, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll take time. Be patient.**\n\nEdit: made formatting changes.

Non-Political,1180,463,1429254246.0,0.92,RajaRajaC,b'My chief sources on the Bengal famine are,\n\n* Poverty and Famines by Amartya Sen\n\n* Unpatriotic history of the Second World War by James Hartfield\n\n* Churchill\'s Secret War by Madhulikha Mukherjee\n\n>Bengal Famine was mostly due to bad weather culminating to crop failure. \n\nFalse. It has been established unequivocally by Sen that 43 had a bumper harvest, food supply was actually increased as compared to 1941. The British were however EXPORTING wheat and Rice was used as a substitute grain to make up for the shortfall caused by wheat exports and this caused a net shortfall.\n\nI will repeat this, Bengal had a better than normal harvest, but the Brits were exporting wheat from India to sustain the British war effort and Rice was used to make up for this shortfall. \n\n>Burmese foodstocks were destroyed by the Japanese causing shortages in Bengal. \n\nIt was not the "Japs" that destroyed food stocks, the food stocks were destroyed even before the Japanese came into Burma thanks to a scorched earth policy. Not only this the Brits seized all modes of transport (primarily boats) that small farmers (the majority of them) used to transport said rice to small local markets.\nRepeated requests to release these modes of transport was rejected, and not till 1944 was this done.\nThe INA even offered 100,000 tons of rice from captured areas (which the Brits hadn\'t scorch earthed yet), the British rejected it.\n\nNot only did the British reject Bose\'s offer, they rejected an offer of 10,000 tons from Canada. The US made an offer for another 100,000 tons, but due to British pressure they backed down. Australia offered another ~ 25,000 tons of wheat but guess what Churchill did? He diverted these food stocks to the Mediterranean to stock up for the Tunisia Campaign - Churchill\'s own command said they had adequate stocks, but nope, Churchill flat out refused to supply Bengal using Australian stocks.\n\nWith me so far? All this is meticulously documented via telegrams, cables, letters and memoirs. \n\nWhat was Churchill\'s response to this....request for food?\n\n>> Isn\'t Gandhi dead? What a pity.\n\n>> They are to be blamed, Indians breed like rabbits\n\n>> They are a beastly people with a beastly religion\n\nIt was so bad (Churchill and his govt\'s attitude) that no less a person than the Viceroy of India, Lord Wavell said,\n\n>> Churchill\'s attitude towards India and the famine is negligent, hostile and contemptuous.\n\n* Lord Wavell, Viceroy of India.\n\n\nLord Wavell bemoaned the fact that Argentina BURNED 2 Mn tonnes of wheat as a substitute for coal (as there was a global shortage) and his offers to ship wheat using Indian shipping was shot down  by the Churchill govt.\n\n\nIt got so bad that the British Seceretary of State in India, Leopold Amery said that Churchill had a Hitler like attitude towards India and Indians. Yes, Churchill was called Hitler by his own Secy of state, but \'famine was caused by \'natural disasters\' right? \n\nNow we go back in time (time for Economics 101) to 1939. India had been supporting the British war effort substantially, iirc we contributed to the tune of 3 Bn GBP (a huge huge sum in 1941) by 1942. How did the Colonial govt deal with this? They printed more Rupees. What does printing of currency do? Cause massive inflation. What does inflation do? Increase the prices of foodgrains (and everything else). Without the war effort  such an inflation wouldn\'t have occured, and 3 Mn Bengalis needn\'t have died in vain. \n\nWith me so far?\n\n* Churchill\n\nChurchill was as racist and as much of a bully as Hitler was, but sadly see he is projected as an all conquering hero. \n\n* India had to support the war effort in Europe while at the same time the INA were traitors.\n\nDo you not see the ridiculous irony in the "brave allies" fighting for freedom and democracy while at the same time holding India as a colony? \n\nWhat the fuck was the difference between German occupied France and British occupied India?\n\nedit - I don\'t care about votes and downvotes, but there is this clique here that seems to think only one camp (the right) does downvoting. Look at my post, within 30 seconds of posting it was down to 30%, went up to 80% and now back down to 70%.\n\nThis is not even a political post, and yet some users here see fit to downvote it blindly. Can we please put the canard that "only one set" downvotes to rest? The unfortunate fact is some users (cutting across camps) downvote blindly and on the basis of usernames and not content.',b'32wdw5',b't3_32wdw5',b'Bengal Famine of 1943 - Causes'

It has been established unequivocally by Sen that 43 had a bumper harvest, food supply was actually increased as compared to 1941. The British were however EXPORTING wheat and Rice was used as a substitute grain to make up for the shortfall caused by wheat exports and this caused a net shortfall.\n\nI will repeat this, Bengal had a better than normal harvest, but the Brits were exporting wheat from India to sustain the British war effort and Rice was used to make up for this shortfall. \n\n>Burmese foodstocks were destroyed by the Japanese causing shortages in Bengal. \n\nIt was not the "Japs" that destroyed food stocks, the food stocks were destroyed even before the Japanese came into Burma thanks to a scorched earth policy. Not only this the Brits seized all modes of transport (primarily boats) that small farmers (the majority of them) used to transport said rice to small local markets.\nRepeated requests to release these modes of transport was rejected, and not till 1944 was this done.\nThe INA even offered 100,000 tons of rice from captured areas (which the Brits hadn\'t scorch earthed yet), the British rejected it.\n\nNot only did the British reject Bose\'s offer, they rejected an offer of 10,000 tons from Canada. The US made an offer for another 100,000 tons, but due to British pressure they backed down. Australia offered another ~ 25,000 tons of wheat but guess what Churchill did? He diverted these food stocks to the Mediterranean to stock up for the Tunisia Campaign - Churchill\'s own command said they had adequate stocks, but nope, Churchill flat out refused to supply Bengal using Australian stocks.\n\nWith me so far? All this is meticulously documented via telegrams, cables, letters and memoirs. \n\nWhat was Churchill\'s response to this....request for food?\n\n>> Isn\'t Gandhi dead? What a pity.\n\n>> They are to be blamed, Indians breed like rabbits\n\n>> They are a beastly people with a beastly religion\n\nIt was so bad (Churchill and his govt\'s attitude) that no less a person than the Viceroy of India, Lord Wavell said,\n\n>> Churchill\'s attitude towards India and the famine is negligent, hostile and contemptuous.\n\n* Lord Wavell, Viceroy of India.\n\n\nLord Wavell bemoaned the fact that Argentina BURNED 2 Mn tonnes of wheat as a substitute for coal (as there was a global shortage) and his offers to ship wheat using Indian shipping was shot down  by the Churchill govt.\n\n\nIt got so bad that the British Seceretary of State in India, Leopold Amery said that Churchill had a Hitler like attitude towards India and Indians. Yes, Churchill was called Hitler by his own Secy of state, but \'famine was caused by \'natural disasters\' right? \n\nNow we go back in time (time for Economics 101) to 1939. India had been supporting the British war effort substantially, iirc we contributed to the tune of 3 Bn GBP (a huge huge sum in 1941) by 1942. How did the Colonial govt deal with this? They printed more Rupees. What does printing of currency do? Cause massive inflation. What does inflation do? Increase the prices of foodgrains (and everything else). Without the war effort  such an inflation wouldn\'t have occured, and 3 Mn Bengalis needn\'t have died in vain. \n\nWith me so far?\n\n* Churchill\n\nChurchill was as racist and as much of a bully as Hitler was, but sadly see he is projected as an all conquering hero. \n\n* India had to support the war effort in Europe while at the same time the INA were traitors.\n\nDo you not see the ridiculous irony in the "brave allies" fighting for freedom and democracy while at the same time holding India as a colony? \n\nWhat the fuck was the difference between German occupied France and British occupied India?\n\nedit - I don\'t care about votes and downvotes, but there is this clique here that seems to think only one camp (the right) does downvoting. Look at my post, within 30 seconds of posting it was down to 30%, went up to 80% and now back down to 70%.\n\nThis is not even a political post, and yet some users here see fit to downvote it blindly.

My village sits right on the Kodai foothills and till the year 2000, our only source of water was a river that ran through the village. The river ran very close to the Ponds factory.\n\nI have since 2001 been seeing an exponential death rate due to cancer. I myself lost my Grandmom to cancer in 2004, my tiny village of around 5,000 people has seen about 250 cancer deaths in just the past 5 years. That is a 5% mortality rate just from cancer. India has by comparision a 0.05% mortality rate. In other words my village has a 8500% greater mortality rate from cancer as compared the nation at large. \n\nIf you factor in other variables like lifestyle caused cancer like Lung cancer because of smoking, and the fact that the vast majority of the 250 dead had none of these (or exposure to pollution for that matter) habits the numbers would look worse.\n\nI want to bring this to the attention of somebody. I am not even looking at a case or a payout or anything, but just to bring this to some form of limelight. Do I just spam media outlets with an email, or should I contact GP / other NGO\'s...ideas are welcome.\n\nFurther studies in case you are interested.\n\n[Studies and Reports on environmental pollution and public health hazard caused by Hindustan Lever in Kodaikanal](http://www.sipcotcuddalore.com/Kodaikanal/studies.htm). \n\n[Berijam lake](http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Blog/Guest-blog/hanging-in-the-mist-mercury-contamination-in-/blog/47184/).\n\n>>Moss samples collected from trees surrounding the Berijam Lake, located 20 km from the factory, were also tested. Mercury levels were in the range of 0.2 \xc2\xb5g/kg, while in Kodaikanal Lake the lichen and moss levels were 7.9 \xc2\xb5g/kg and 8.3 \xc2\xb5g/kg, respectively. Fish samples from the Kodaikanal Lake also showed mercury levels in the range of 120 to 290 mg/kg.\n\n>>The fish in Kodaikanal Lake are contaminated, and this has caused the loss of livelihood for many people. Water as far as Madurai, a major city about 130kms from Kodaikanal, has been contaminated. That\'s no surprise because the contaminated water from the mountains was bound to flow onto the plains below.\n\nThis article talks about a town 130 Km\'s away and one that has no direct linkage to it via any river. My village is 20 kms from Berijam (about 50 km\'s by road), and the river in question, the [Varaha](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/varaha-river-to-flow-unimpeded/article2661510.ece) originated in Berijam. We are upstream, one of the first major settlements on the river, so the pollution and sewage that eventually killed the river really didn\'t matter to us. \n\nEdit - Throwaway for obvious reasons. Don\'t want this post to be sidetracked by petty partisanship.\n\nedit 2 - Guys, have received PM\'s from Timesnow. Livemint has contacted the mods, and the mods have provided me a contact id. I have also been contacted (via) PM of an international NGO that looks into such cases.\n\nTo be honest I never expected this kind of traction and it is kind of scary now, but I am going to go ahead and email these three entities whatever info it is they require as well as put them onto people in my village.\n\nedit 3 : 6th June 2015, 1300 IST - Guys,  I have initiated contact with 3 Indian Media outlets (big names) who reached out to me. I am now going to go by what they recommend next.\n\nI will keep this thread updated as and when there is a d4evelopment. I have also been approached by 3 reddit users who kindly offered me their labs to test if I need so, but right now, I only have sketchy data to go by (as others here have pointed). I am going to co-operate with the media names and first see if something comes up via their more extensive due diligence.\n\nThank you. Just to reassure you (that I am not misusing the goodwill of the forum) the issue is real, maybe the cause is not mercury directly, but something is poisoning my village and my post was and remains well intentioned and not a "troll post" as a few have alleged via PM.',b'38heyu',b't3_38heyu',b'Help, ideas needed.

We spoke with the police for about 5 min and went on our way.\n\nIn the end, even though we looked like the perpetrator (when we stopped in front of the victim to block traffic), the police didn't give us any problems.\n\nThe purpose of this post was to highlight how the bystander effect is so true. Nobody thought of calling and ambulance or police. Nobody waited to help the victim. Also surprised that an ambulance can show up so quickly.\n\nedit : I have a dashcam. [I just uploaded the file here.](https://gfycat.com/WindingNeedyCod)\n\nedit 2: as u/boredmonk pointed out, I dialed 108 for the ambulance and 100 for police from my friend's mobile phone (on international roaming). No Country code or city code required.\n\nedit 3: I've received beautiful words from you guys. Thank you all.",b'a3karl',b't3_a3karl',b'[NP] I called the police and ambulance on a road accident victim. Ambulance shows up in 4 min, police show up in 20.'
